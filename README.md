## Python Final Project
## Heart Failure Prediction
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) is a global cause of mortality, claiming 17.9 million lives each year, and contributing to 31% of all deaths worldwide. Heart failure, often a consequence of CVDs, requires early identification. This dataset aims to empower predictive modelling for heart disease.
The dataset has a total of 918 entries with 11 features, including both numerical and categorical features, providing diverse insights into cardiovascular health. The features include: Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, Resting Blood Pressure, Serum Cholesterol, Fasting Blood Sugar, Resting ECG, Max Heart Rate, Exercise Angina, Old peak, ST Segment Slope.
